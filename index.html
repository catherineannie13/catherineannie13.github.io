            Hi, I'm Catherine, a fourth-year computer science major at Minerva University, a highly-selective global university with whom I travel all over the globe. This experience has given me invaluable skills, not only with programming and data science, but also open-mindedness and the ability to approach a problem from a diverse range of perspectives. During my undergraduate course, I am travelling to San Francisco, South Korea, Germany, Argentina, India, Taiwan and the UK to overcome cultural barriers and build resilience in unfamiliar environments.<br><br>
            As someone who only discovered the world of coding 3 years ago, I have become extremely driven to learn and adapt to this new and exciting world. Since then, I have decided to major in computer science, completed hackathons, and several online courses such as Datacamp's Data Science Track. I have skills in data analysis, modelling and machine learning in Python, R and SQL/BigQuery, web design in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and several research internships under my belt.<br><br>
            In summer 2023 I completed my first data science internship at King. Here, I worked with their Central Insights team to develop a compartment model to predict unknown and future player data. I harnessed several skills during this time including querying (using Google's BigQuery), understanding how models represent simplifications of real-world scenarios, and Python programming skills. I absolutely loved this internship, particularly being able to see the real-life applications of my work. I can't wait to see where my Data Science journey takes me next!<br><br>
            I am currently a teaching assistant for a computer science course (Modelling Complex Systems) with key skills in curriculum design and problem-solving. My long-term career goals are to use technology to advance scientific research, whether this be at a company aligned with this aim, or at a my own startup. I also have strong interests in the applications of data science to both health and education.<br><br>
