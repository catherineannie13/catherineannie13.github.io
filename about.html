        What is Minerva University?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Ranked #1 most innovative university by World's Universities with Real Impact (WURI), and the most selective US university, with a 2% acceptance rate each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Minerva, I travel to 7 different countries (USA, South Korea, Germany, Argentina, India, UK, Taiwan) over the course of my 4-year bachelor program. Thus far, I have developed a strong resilience to whatever life may throw at me, and a will to reach for bigger and better goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important community to me is my university cohort. Being in a group of only 100 students in my year, I feel I give and receive a great deal of support in my community, primarily in the ways I have listed above. Coming from over 40 different countries, we all have varying perspectives and values. Since attending Minerva, I have become more open-minded and able to see the world through other perspectives than my own because of this. I often use these alternative viewpoints not only in daily life but also to approach my academic work.

        <p>
          On my global rotation as part of Minerva University, I find it very important to interact with the local community. In San Francisco, I and three other students worked with the Downtown Streets Team, an organisation run individuals who haev personally experienced homelessness, to research how we may change the public perception of homelessness in San Francisco. Working within this team of individuals from such different backgrounds allowed me to understand the importance of diverse perspectives even more so. This allowed us to produce a more well-rounded, and well-informed resource that could be used by Downtown Streets Team in their efforts to support homeless individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          My responsibilities throughout the project were to ensure accountability and time management from all team members, setting deadlines to keep us on track. I also took on the bulk of the deliverable presentation, including a SWOT analysis of homeless individuals, identifying organisations that aim to better the lives of homeless individuals, and carrying out a multiple causes analyses to better understand why individuals struggle to break free from the cycle of homelessness.

        Seoul, South Korea
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          With a few other Minervan students, I volunteered to help clean up streets and pick up litter, an initiative started by some Yongsan locals. During this time, I discovered much about the local area, and about the lives of locals in Seoul. To thank us for helping out, a local history professor gave us a walking tour around Yongsan, the area in which we lived. The aim of this was to educate us on where we live, how we can interact on a deeper level with locals, and to impart on us knowledge that we may take with us to educate others all over the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to fully interact with the professor, I found it helpful to actively empathise with South Koreans, and to approach the activity with a very open mind, so as not to impact my intuitive reaction to his teachings. I found that this allowed me to understand more of the motives behind the actions of both South Koreans and governmental bodies over time, and therefore gain even more respect for their culture and traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time in South Korea, I also interacted with a couple who owned a local restaurant, Hanool. I frequently learned new aspects of the local culture from them, as well as teaching them about my culture.

        Berlin, Germany
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          During my time in Berlin, I found the best way to immerse myself in the local culture and learn about the history of the city was through museums and events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Berlinale- I attended a film by a first-time producer called My Small Land. It was filmed in 3 languages: Kurdish, a specific dialect of Kurdish, and Japanese. The aim of this was to expose us to small producers as well as to allow us to learn more deeply about such cultures. In order to address the challenge, I approached the film from a very open-minded viewpoint, ensuring that my interpretive lens did not skew my initial judgement of the film. Furthermore, I also read up on the author and her life prior to watching to try and understand her lens and use this to help inform my interpretation of the movie. As a result of watching the film, I felt inspired about the history of Kurdish people and more specifically the emigration of individuals such as the family in the film to escape persecution in their home country. I felt compelled to research more about these and try to understand their very unique history which I had never discovered before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Museum of Terrors- I have learned so much about the history of Germany and its surrounding countries during the war. For example, there was a time when they would hang high-ranking Jews during the start of the war. Several times when the individuals feet still touched the ground, the soldiers were forced to lift them up in the air and hold them while the were hanged (killing them). Stories such as this helped me to engage more with the city, and to understand the rich history of Berlin.

        <p>
          During my stay in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I wholeheartedly embraced the world of Tango. Enrolling in a Tango class led by an enthusiastic local instructor, I discovered that Tango transcends danceâ€”it's a cultural gem. I absorbed the dance's intricate steps, its captivating blend of African and European musical influences, and the nuances of technique and connection that define it. This immersion profoundly enriched my appreciation for Tango's integral role in Argentina's cultural tapestry and its historical significance. The experience left me with a deep affection for Tango's music, dance, and heritage, making it a cherished part of my time in Buenos Aires.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my Tango adventure, I also had the incredible opportunity to explore the diverse landscapes of Argentina. From cascading waterfalls like Iguazu Falls to the majestic Andes Mountains, serene lakes, and lush forests, this country's natural beauty was awe-inspiring. I found myself surrounded by the raw power of nature at the foot of the falls, felt the exhilaration of hiking in the Andes, marveled at the crystal-clear lakes, and found solace in the midst of verdant forests. Each new landscape was a testament to Argentina's breathtaking ecological diversity, offering me a chance to connect with the country's natural wonders and appreciate the immense variety of landscapes it has to offer.

        <p>
          My time in Hyderabad, India, was an enlightening journey into a city steeped in history and cultural diversity. Hyderabad's rich heritage, dating back to the 16th century when it was established by the Qutub Shahi dynasty, left me in awe. Exploring historical marvels like Charminar, Golconda Fort, and the Qutb Shahi tombs revealed the city's deep-rooted past. Surprisingly, Hyderabad's nickname as the "City of Pearls" echoed its history as a hub for precious gem and pearl trade.
        </p>
        <p>
The culinary scene in Hyderabad was a delightful surprise, offering spicy and aromatic biryanis, mouthwatering kebabs, haleem, and other delectable dishes. The city's strong coffee culture, with traditional Irani cafes serving unique coffee and tea blends alongside tasty snacks, added another layer to my gastronomic journey.
        </p>
        <p>
However, my time in India wasn't just about exploration; it also opened my eyes to the stark reality of poverty. Witnessing families living in challenging conditions, struggling to meet basic needs, underscored the privileges I have, such as education and healthcare access. This experience has ignited a profound sense of gratitude and a desire to contribute meaningfully to alleviate poverty and support those in need.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          At the R.U.Hacking Hackathon event (Reading, UK), me and my partner developed an idea and basic prototype for an app that takes symptoms, and intelligently gives advice using deep learning. The app also has options to locate appropriate medication and medical advisors nearby. Though this idea was never fully formed, this experience gave me a sense of what it means to develop ideas from the conceptualisation stage to the prototype stage.

          The Inspiration - In the modern world of medicine, there are so many drugs out there to treat so many different minor illnesses, often overlapping in effects. This makes it very difficult for individuals to know which medicine is best suited to their symptoms and conditions. Personally, the number of times I have had a headache and not known which medicine to take is countless. Internet searches retrieve no useful results and are often unreliable, leading to forums containing no responses from professionals. Furthermore, contacting the doctors is time-consuming and unnecessary for such minor illnesses, especially in Covid-19 times. Thus, there is a lack of reliable sources to obtain the optimal medication, which results in a) no medicine and continued suffering, or, even worse, b) a complete guess at which drug to take. The consequences could be harmful, worsening an individual's condition in a potentially life-threatening manner.

          During my gap year between high school and university, I started a business tutoring maths and science to students aged 12-18. I started a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/catherinejacksontutor/">Facebook page</a> to market myself to potential customers. Over the course of 1.5 years, I tutored over 700 hours and effectively increased my students' exam grades. I fostered outstanding learning environments where students wanted to learn, and tutored several students with learning disabilities (dyslexia, dyscalculia, ADHD).

        <p>
          During high school, me and 2 friends started a business making and selling our own unique jewellery. We sold over 100 units, and made over Â£500 from our stock by attending local fairs and events. My main role in the business was to cost out materials and calculate profit margins. This experience gave me a flavour of what it means to start a business, and the skills that are required to do so. I would like to start a business in the future because of this venture.
